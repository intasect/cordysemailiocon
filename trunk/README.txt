====================================
Welcome to the Cordys E-mail IO Connector
====================================
This connector can be used to react to inbound mail traffic. Sometimes you need to start a flow (or call any web service) based on an email that was received.
You'd also like to get the details of an attachment, parse it and get data from it to feed to the process. This is all possible with this connector.
The second feature for this connector is that it is also able to send mails. 
It is compatible with the standard Cordys email web services, so it can function as a substitute for the standard Cordys email connector.
